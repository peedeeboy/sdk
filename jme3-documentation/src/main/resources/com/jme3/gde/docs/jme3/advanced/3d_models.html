<p>
Like <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/advanced/shape.html">Shape</a>s, 3D models are also made up of <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/advanced/mesh.html">Mesh</a>es, but models are more complex than Shapes. While Shapes are built into jME3, you typically create models in external 3D Mesh Editors.

<h2>Using Models and Scenes with jME3</h2>
<div>

<p>
To use 3D models in a jME3 application:
</p>
<ol>
<li><div> Export the 3D model in GLTF or Wavefront OBJ format. Export Scenes as GLTF format.</div>
</li>
<li><div> Save the files into a subdirectory of your jME3 project&#039;s <code>assets</code> directory.</div>
</li>
<li><div> In your code, you use the <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/advanced/asset_manager.html">Asset Manager</a> to load models as <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/jme3/advanced/spatial.html">Spatial</a>s into a jME application. <pre>Spatial model = assetManager.loadModel&#40;
    &quot;Models/MonkeyHead/MonkeyHead.mesh.xml&quot; &#41;;</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li><div> (For the release build:) Use the jMonkeyEngine SDK to convert models to .j3o format. You don&#039;t need this step as long you still develop and test the aplication within the jMonkeyEngine SDK.</div>
</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
You can now use the <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/sdk.html">jMonkeyEngine SDK</a> to <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/sdk/model_loader_and_viewer.html">load and view models</a>. You can <a href="/com/jme3/gde/docs/sdk/scene_composer.html">create scenes</a> from them and write code that loads them into your application. 
</p>
