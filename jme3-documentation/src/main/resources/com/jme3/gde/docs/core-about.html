        <h2>About jMonkeyEngine SDK</h2>
        <p>
            The jMonkeyEngine SDK (or "jMonkeyPlatform") is a game development environment for jMonkeyEngine 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            The jMonkeyEngine SDK is based on the NetBeans Platform so you automatically have access to all of the
            developer tools of the NetBeans IDE to create, compile and deploy Java applications.
            On top of that, the jMonkeyEngine SDK provides you with specialized plugins for creating jMonkeyEngine 3 game content.
        </p>
        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>
            This help contains info about most of the functions of the jMonkeyEngine SDK, take a look at the
            "Introduction" section of the help to get started with <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/sdk/project_creation.html">creating projects</a>. The sections
            on <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/sdk/model_loader_and_viewer.html">model</a> and <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/sdk/material_editing.html">material</a> handling will give you information on how you can manage and edit
            your game assets. Finally theres information about how jMonkeyPlatform helps you
            <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/sdk/code_editor.html">edit your code</a> and <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/sdk/application_deployment.html">deploy your application</a> to multiple platforms.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>
            If you are completely new to jMonkeyEngine we suggest you go through the <a href="/com/jme3/gde/core/docs/jme3/beginner/hello_simpleapplication.html">jMonkeyEngine3 tutorials</a>
            first, they will give you an idea on how jMonkeyEngine works and contain lots of little
            good-to-knows that will help you getting your Application up and running in no time.
        </p>
        <p>
            To see some code examples of jMonkeyEngine3 functions, press the "New Project" button and
            create a new "JME3Tests" project. To start coding, create a new "BasicGame" project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have fun coding!<br/>

To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
